My observations

Steve Jobs quote about bicycles

Using AI tools to help with coding is like going from a bicycle to a motorcycle. You can go a lot faster and go futher with less effort. But you still need to know how to ride the motorcycle, balance like you did on the bicycle, and navigate where you want to go. You also need to be a lot more careful about driving safely. There's a reason why motorcycle helments are a lot bigger than bicycle helmets. Show Tesla accident with white truck. Human error

prefer ESM over common.js
prefer export functions over final exports
