Break up problems into multiple steps.

## Steps

1. Create a new file for the problem.
2. Write the code for the problem.
3. Run the code.
4. Debug the code.
5. Refactor the code.
6. Test the code.

## Prompt user login and signup

```text
Users must be able to register, sign up, and log in.

Don't add any JWT code or anything like that, just generate a user model (without using classes) in the models folder. Also generate sign up and log in routes, (e.g. `/users/signup` in the routes folder.

Last but not least, add the code for linking route and model to a user's controller (controllers folder).

Don't add any code for storing user data in a database yet

```

Note have to use `cmd shift v` to past into chat, otherwise it adds the files with the lines, but you can't execute the prompt.
